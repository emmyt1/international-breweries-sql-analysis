# International Breweries Data Analysis Project
A detailed SQL analysis on international breweries sales data to derive profit and sales insights.


## 📊 Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of international breweries sales data across West African countries from 2017 to 2019. The goal was to use SQL to derive insights into profitability, brand performance, and sales trends to aid strategic decision-making.

## 🎯 Business Objectives
- **Profit Analysis:** Compare profitability between Anglophone and Francophone territories.
- **Brand Analysis:** Identify top-performing brands in key markets like Ghana, Nigeria, and Senegal.
- **Country Analysis:** Determine the country with the highest consumption and profit.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **SQL:** For data querying and analysis.
- **PostgreSQL:** Database management system.
- **Microsoft Excel:** For initial data cleaning and preparation.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset contains sales records with the following key columns:
- `countries`, `region`, `sales_rep`
- `brands`, `quantity`, `profit`
- `years`, `months`

## 🔍 Key SQL Features Demonstrated
- Aggregation Functions (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `MAX`, `MIN`)
- Filtering (`WHERE`, `IN`)
- Sorting (`ORDER BY`)
- Grouping (`GROUP BY`)
- Subqueries
- Limiting Results (`LIMIT`)

## 📈 Key Insights
